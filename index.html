			<h1>5 Years From Now</h1>
			<p>
				Way back before I entered here, my passion was to only
				draw.
			</p>
			<p>
				I would draw various things that I like, which are mostly
				about animes and the likes.
			</p>
			<p>
				Now that I entered college, I tried my best to learn
				everything that I could. But that ate up a lot of my time.
			</p>
			<p>And that costed me my only hobby.</p>
			<p>Fortunately, I found programming.</p>
			<p>
				Just like when I'm drawing, I could find myself getting
				sucked in when programming my activities and projects â€”
				later finding that it would already be midnight when I
				finished.
			</p>
			<p>
				And now I am sure that 5 years from now, I can see myself
				entering the IT industry.
			</p>
			<p>
				Though, I cannot imagine what kind of experiences and
				challenges I will face throughout my stay there...
			</p>
			<p>I am sure that I will do my best to learn and improve.</p>
