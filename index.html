			<h1>5 Years From Now</h1>
			<p>Way back before I entered here, my passion was to only
			   draw.</p>
			<p>I would draw various things that I like, which are mostly
			   about animes and the likes.</p>

			<p>Now that I entered college, I tried my best to learn
			   everything that I could. But that ate up a lot of my time.</p>
			<p>And that costed me my only hobby.</p>
			<p>Fortunately, I found programming.</p>
			<p>Just like when I'm drawing, I could find myself getting
			   sucked in when programming my activities and projects â€”
			   later finding that it would already be midnight when I
			   finished.</p>
			<p>While it definitely wasn't easy, it also brought along a sense
			   of fulfillment which I could feel whenever I see my program 
			   working as I intended.</p>
			<p>And now I am sure that 5 years from now, I can see myself
			   entering the IT industry.</p>
			<p>Though, I cannot imagine what kind of experiences and
			   challenges I will face throughout my stay there...</p>
			<p>I am sure that I will do my best to learn and improve.</p>
